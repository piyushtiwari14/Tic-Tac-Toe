# Python Tic Tac Toe

This Python program implements a simple Tic Tac Toe game where a player competes against the computer.

## Description

- The game allows players to take turns placing their symbol ('X' for the player and 'O' for the computer) on a 3x3 board.
- Players aim to align their symbols horizontally, vertically, or diagonally to win the game.
- The computer opponent employs a basic strategy to make its moves, ensuring a challenging gameplay experience.

## Usage

1. Run the Python script `tic tac toe.py`.
2. Enter the position (1-9) to place an 'X' on the board when prompted.
3. The computer will then make its move and display the updated board.
4. Continue taking turns until one player wins or the game ends in a tie.
